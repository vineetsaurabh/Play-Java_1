First, list all the files that have been modified since the last commit.

git status

Add the files you want to commit individually.

git add location/file_name.rb git add location/file_name2.rb ...

Make commit to the files you added to push.

git commit -m "committing files one at a time or two at a time"

Now push

git push heroku
